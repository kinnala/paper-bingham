** File overview

*** apriori.py

This script runs the circle example.
It is possible to change the refinement level by modifying the definition
of the variable /m/ on line 16.
It is possible to change the method by modifying the case index
on line 48 (0 = MINI, 1 = P2P0, 2 = P1P0 (unstable), 3 = P3P1).
This script is run several times and it writes
to file /apriori_circle_<method name>.csv/.
The file is read by /apriori_plots.py/ to draw the convergence plots.
